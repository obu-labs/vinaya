When you open a rule file, you'll see something like this:

Let's walk through each part of this step-by-step:

|--|--|
| Path | The path of the rule file. |
| Filename | The name of the rule. Type `[[` and a Filename to link to a note from one of your own notes. |
| SC UID | Sutta Central's Unique Identifier for this rule. <br /> In Obsidian, you can also use `aliases` to link to a note. |
| The Rule | The Pāli text of the rule along with Ajahn Brahmali's translation |
| Definitions | Any terms defined in the Vibhaṅga will get hyperlinked. |
| Variant Footnotes | If there are any variant readings known to SuttaCentral, these will appear as footnotes off that term. |

| External links | Any links with a {{< icon open_in_new >}} at the end will open in your browser. (On Desktop, you can enable "{{< icon settings >}} → Core plugins → Web viewer" to open external links in Obsidian itself.) |

## Digging Deeper

Below the rule itself, you'll find various links to dig deeper into the rule:

### Vibhaṅga

The **Vibhaṅga** section links to the various parts of the Pāli Canon's own commentary on the rule.

### Next

**Next** takes you to the next rule. This enables reading and studying the rules in order.  
**Pro tip**: you can use Obsidian's [bookmarks feature](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/bookmarks) to save your place.

### Footnotes

Here you'll find the footnotes on the rule mentioned above.
Clicking the ↵ at the end will scroll you back up to that note's reference location.
Some of Ajahn Brahmali's notes contain links to further discussion within his Appendices.

### Linked mentions (aka "Backlinks")

Here you'll find a dynamic list of all the links across the vault that link to this rule.
In the above screenshot, you can see the Bhikkhunī parallel rule
and Ajahn Geoff's chapter on this rule in The BMCv1.
This section can be a good way to see if anyone else in your vault has written about this rule.
