## Modules

To view the files in your vault:
  1. Open the Obsidian sidebar by clicking the {{< icon view_sidebar flipx >}} icon on the top left corner of the app.
  2. Make sure you're looking at the "Files" {{< icon folder_open >}} tab of the sidebar.
  3. You'll see all the folders in your vault:

Each of the top-level folders in your Vinaya Notebook is called a "module."

Currently, the Vinaya Notebook Plugin syncs the following modules:
{{< list_modules >}}

But new modules may be added any time!
The Vinaya Notebook Plugin updates in the background to keep these modules up to date.

## Opening a Rule File

The central hub of the **Vinaya Notebook** are the Pātimokkha rule files.
To open a rule, open the "Canon (Pali)" module's "Patimokkha" folder
and navigate to the rule you're interested in.
