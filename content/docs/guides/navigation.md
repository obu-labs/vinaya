## Modules

To view the files in your vault:
  1. Open the Obsidian sidebar by clicking the {{< icon view_sidebar flipx >}} icon on the top left corner of the app.
  2. Make sure you're looking at the "Files" {{< icon folder_open >}} tab of the sidebar.
  3. You'll see all the folders in your vault:

Each of the top-level folders in your Vinaya Notebook is called a "module."

Currently, the Vinaya Notebook Plugin syncs the following modules:
{{< list_modules >}}

The Vinaya Notebook Plugin updates in the background to keep these modules up to date.

You should keep your notes in a folder alongside these modules with your name.
That way you can easily copy your module over to someone else's vault if you ever want to share your notes with them!
In this way, the "Vinaya Notes Modules" are not limited to the "official" modules
listed above, but can include any modules people might want to create and share in the future!

## Opening a Rule File

The central hub of the **Vinaya Notebook** are the Pātimokkha rule files.
To open a rule, open the "Canon (Pali)" module's "Patimokkha" folder
and navigate to the rule you're interested in.
