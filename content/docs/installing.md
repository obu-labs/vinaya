## Overview

1. Install Obsidian
2. Download the vault
3. Activate it

## Install Obsidian

The **Vinaya Notebook** is built on top of [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/), an open-source note-taking app.
If you don't have Obsidian installed, you can [download it here](https://obsidian.md/download).

For information on using the vault with other notes apps, see [Other Notes Apps](reference/other-apps).

## Download the vault

Download the latest version of the vault [**here**](vinaya-notes.zip).

## Installing

1. Extract the vault anywhere convenient for you.  
  (For example, if you'd like your notes to be synced to the cloud, you might extract the vault to your cloud drive folder.)
2. Open Obsidian, click "[Manage Vaults](https://help.obsidian.md/manage-vaults)" and open the folder as a new vault.
3. Obsidian will ask if you trust the vault:

  Click "**Trust author and enable plugins**" to enable the Vinaya Notebook plugin.
4. Obsidian will open the Settings page to show you that the Vinaya Notebook plugin has been enabled.
5. Close the settings modal and the plugin will guide you through the rest of the setup.
