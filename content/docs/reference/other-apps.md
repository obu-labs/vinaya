The vault should also work with:
 - [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com/)
 - [QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org/)
 - [Notable](https://notable.app/)
 - or the markdown editor of your choice

However, these will have to be updated manually, as the Notebook Plugin only works with Obsidian.

## Zettlr

To install in Zettlr, merely extract the archive anywhere, then select
"File -> Open Workspace" and open the vault folder.

## QOwnNotes

In QOwnNotes, either extract the vault to your "default" notes folder
or go to "Settings -> Note folders" and "Add folder" pointing to where you extracted
the archive.
Be sure to select the "Use note subfolders" option in either case.

## Notable

Notable has a "Data Directory."  To import the vault into Notable,
"Open Data Directory" and then extract the zip archive there.
Note that you may need to restart the app to see the notes.

## Feedback

If you use these or any other Markdown-compatible notes app and notice an issue,
feel free to [report it](https://github.com/obu-labs/vinaya/issues).
