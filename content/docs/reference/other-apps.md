The vault should also work with:
 - [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com/)
 - [QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org/)
 - [Notable](https://notable.app/)
 - or the markdown editor of your choice

However, these will have to be updated manually, as the Notebook Plugin only works with Obsidian.

If you use one of these other apps and notice an issue, feel free to [report it](https://github.com/obu-labs/vinaya/issues).
